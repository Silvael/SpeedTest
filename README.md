# script which detects the speed of your internet connection -  written and tested in Python 3.6

#before usage goto http://www.speedtestx.de and fill out the captcha to get download permission

Calculation is done by the formula: 
data in bytes * 8  : 1.000.000 : seconds    
remember:  one bytes is 8 Bit   :-)   

e.g. in my place it takes about 16 seconds to download a 100 MB File

this fits to  the values given in
http://www.dsl-rechner.de/dsl-speedrechner.html

VDSL 50 MBit	(51.200 kbps)	0 Std	0 Min	16 Sek	f√ºr 100 MB

as my current connection is VSDL 50 MBit  and i get this speed as long as my kids are sleeping or at school ;-)

Seconds total: 16.442435
Data loaded:  104857600 bytes  == 100.0 Megabyte 
Speed: 51.018039603015005 Mbit/s  (  calculated by formula:  data in bytes * 8  : 1.000.000 : seconds )
